Version 1.0

* Implemented graphics from PSAgraphics using ggplot2.
* loess.psa optionally provides panels above and right for the density distributions
  of the propensity scores and unadjusted outcome, respectively.
* Added check to ensure the items parameter on the likert function is a data frame.
  Also added an example to the likert demo to show how to use likert with only
  one item. Hint, use the drop=FALSE parameter when subsetting.

TODO

* cv.bal.psa from PSAgraphics is now multibalance.plot.
* box.psa and cat.psa from PSAgraphics is now balance.plot. This function will
  choose the appropriate type of graphic (i.e. box versus bar) based upon the 
  class type of the covariate.
* balance.plot will create a grid of balance plots if more than one covariate
  is passed in.
* circ.psa from PSAgraphics is now circ.plot.
* cstrata.psa is now ps.plot. This function incorporates features from other
  functions including overlaying strata.
* psa.boot implements bootstrap methods for matching and stratification.


Look at Kolgomorov-Smirnov 2 sample test (bal.ks.psa) and Fisher's Exact test
for indpendence (bal.fe.psa). bal.ms.psa
